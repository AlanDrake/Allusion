# Custom themes

This folder contains a couple of theme presets, that will be copied to the user's Allusion custom themes directory when installing Allusion.

## Creating a custom theme
The default theme of Allusion can be used as a reference, which can be found in the `/resources/style/remake/themes.scss` file of Allusion's source code, which can be found [here](https://github.com/allusion-app/Allusion/blob/master/resources/style/remake/themes.scss).

Feel free to share yours and try those of others through the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/allusion-app/Allusion/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)!

## Loading a custom theme
1. Open the settings panel
2. In Appearance > Custom themes, click the "Open" button to open the "themes" folder
3. Create a `.css` file with the name of your theme and customize it to your liking
4. Click the Refresh button in the settings panel
5. Pick the theme from the dropdown menu
6. Enjoy!
